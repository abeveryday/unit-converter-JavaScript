        Miles originated from the Roman mille passus, or “thousand paces,” which
        measured 5,000 Roman feet. ... During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I,
        the mile gained an additional 280 feet—to 5,280—under a statute of 1593
        that confirmed the use of a shorter foot that made the length of the
        furlong 660 feet

        A yard was originally the length of a man's belt or girdle, as it was
        called. In the 12th century, King Henry I of England fixed the yard as
        the distance from his nose to the thumb of his out-stretched arm. Today
        it is 36 inches.
