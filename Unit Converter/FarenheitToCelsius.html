      conversion formula:

      <div class="first">
        Fahrenheit temperature scale, scale based on 32° for the freezing point
        of water and 212° for the boiling point of water, the interval between
        the two being divided into 180 equal parts. The 18th-century German
        physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit originally took as the zero of his
        scale the temperature of an equal ice-salt mixture and selected the
        values of 30° and 90° for the freezing point of water and normal body
        temperature, respectively; these later were revised to 32° and 96°, but
        the final scale required an adjustment to 98.6° for the latter value.

        Celsius, also called centigrade, scale based on 0° for the freezing
        point of water and 100° for the boiling point of water. Invented in 1742
        by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, it is sometimes called the
        centigrade scale because of the 100-degree interval between the defined
        points. The following formula can be used to convert a temperature from
        its representation on the Fahrenheit (°F) scale to the Celsius (°C)
        value:
