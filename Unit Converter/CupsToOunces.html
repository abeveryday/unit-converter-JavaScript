        As a unit of weight, the ounce derives from the Roman uncia (meaning
        “twelfth part”), which was 1/12 of a Roman foot or ounce. The standard
        or physical embodiment of the Roman foot, a copper bar, constituted the
        Roman pound standard and was divided along its length into 12 equal
        parts, called unciae.
