        The foot as a measure was used in almost all cultures and was usually
        divided into 12, sometimes 10 inches / thumbs or into 16 fingers /
        digits. The first known standard foot measure was from Sumer, where a
        definition is given in a statue of Gudea of Lagash from around 2575 BC.

        The French originated the meter in the 1790s as one/ten-millionth of the
        distance from the equator to the north pole along a meridian through
        Paris. ... The U. S. Congress legalized the use of the metric system in
        1866 on the basis that one meter is exactly equal to 39.37 inches.
